   <h2>Chamber music project: The Prophet/Songs of Today and Yesterday</h2>
  <p><strong>Performers:Sarah Marine (flute), John Sturt (voice), Charis Hanning (piano)</strong> 
  <p>These chamber music performances, for our flute, baritone and piano ensemble, are centered around Khalil Gibran´s famous book, "The Prophet", an important and beautiful work of poetry and philosophy. In 2025, I commissioned <a href="https://www.johnsturtcomposer.co.uk/">John Sturt</a> to write a setting of this text. The result is a charming hour-long song cycle with engaging narration. </p>
